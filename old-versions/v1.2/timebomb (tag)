	description:Many IRC bots have a "timebomb" fun command that provides endless hours of ensuing fun with other users. It works a little like this:{newline;2}{//;
    }• User A uses the "timebomb" command on User B.{newline}{//;
    }• The IRC bot will ping User B and present them with a selection of coloured wires to cut, along with how much time is on the fuse.{newline}{//;
    }• User B needs to respond back with the correct colour in order to defuse the bomb.{newline}{//;
    }• If User B guesses the right colour, they are saved.{newline}{//;
    }• If User B guesses the wrong colour, or if they don't respond by the time the timer runs out, the bomb will go off.{newline;2}{//;
    }I couldn't find any equivalent functionality on Discord, so I made my own implementation using blargbot's BBTag language. It works pretty well, and of course, I'm making the code for it open to everyone.{newline;2}{//;
    }**Cool! How do I add this to my server?**{newline;2}{//;
    }Since this command needs the ``send`` tag, which is disabled on the public tags system, you'll need to import this command into your server as a custom command in order for it to work. Before you begin, double-check the following:{newline;2}{//;
    }• You are either the Owner of, or have Admin permissions on, the server you want to add it to.{newline}{//;
    }• blargbot has permissions to Read and Send Messages, Add Emoji Reactions, and Read Message History.{newline;2}{//;
    }You can then import the command in two ways:{newline;2}{//;
    }1. Import this command to your server by typing ``b!cc import timebomb``. It will be available for use right away, with no additional setup, and you'll get the latest updates to the command automatically.{newline}{//;
    }2. Import the command manually, which will give you more control over the command and allow you to customize it to your liking. Instructions can be found on [my blog](https://k6ka.blogspot.com/2020/05/timebomb-command-for-discord.html).{newline;2}{//;
    }I highly encourage you to give this a go and invite some of your friends over to play around with it. Relive some classic IRC fun right in the modern comforts of Discord!;
