# Discord Timebomb

The "timebomb" command was a fun command found on several IRC bots that provided a light, entertaining form of amusement and user engagement. It worked a little like this:

* User A uses the "timebomb" command on User B.
* The IRC bot will ping User B and present them with a selection of coloured wires to cut, along with how much time is on the fuse.
* User B needs to respond back with the correct colour in order to defuse the bomb.
* If User B guesses the right colour, they are saved.
* If User B guesses the wrong colour, or if they don't respond by the time the timer runs out, the bomb will go off.

This is a recreation of the classic IRC timebomb command for [Discord](https://discord.com/), a popular web-based chat service. It is written for [blargbot](https://blargbot.xyz/), an open source Discord bot that can be added to any Discord server for free.
